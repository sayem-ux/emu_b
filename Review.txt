Chapter1:
- HTML pages are text documents.
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

Chapter2:
- Html elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
- They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

Chapter3:
- There are three types of HTML lists: ordered,unordered, and definition.
- Ordered lists use numbers.
- Unordered lists use bullets.
- Definition lists are used to define terminology.
- Lists can be nested inside one another.

Notes: 
absolute URLS require domain name of foreign websites
relative URLS are pages that are part of the site that
is being accessed so in the current directory.
