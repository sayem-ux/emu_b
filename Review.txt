Chapter1: Structure
- HTML pages are text documents.
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

Chapter2: Text
- Html elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
- They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

Chapter3: Lists
- There are three types of HTML lists: ordered,unordered, and definition.
- Ordered lists use numbers.
- Unordered lists use bullets.
- Definition lists are used to define terminology.
- Lists can be nested inside one another.

Notes: 
absolute URLS require domain name of foreign websites
relative URLS are pages that are part of the site that
is being accessed so in the current directory.

Chapter4: Links
- Links are created using the <a> element.
- The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
- You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
- You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

Chapter5: Images

The <img> element is used to add images to a web page.
You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.
You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

Notes: 
Block elements appear on a new line
Inline elements sit within a block level element and do Not start on a new line. 
Empty elements don't have end tag. Have no content.

1)Save images in right format
2)Save images at the right size
3)use the correct resolution

Chapter6: Tables
- The <table> element is used to add tables to a web page.
- A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the <tr> element.
- Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a header).
- You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
- For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>.

Notes:

   -Part of the reason for having separate <thead> and <tfoot> 
    elements is so that, if you have a table that is taller than the 
    screen (or, if printed, longer than one page) then the browser 
    can keep the header and footer visible whilst the contents of 
    the table scroll.

Chapter7:  Forms

- Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a <form> element.
- Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
- Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.
- HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.

Chapter8:  Extra Markup
- DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
- You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
- The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
- <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
- The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
- Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
