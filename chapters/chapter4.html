        <h3 id="Register">Registers</h3>
        <p>Registers are a type of computer memory  used to 
            quickly accept, store, and transfer data and instructions 
            that are being used immediately by the CPU</p>
       
        <h3 id="Counters">Counters</h3>
        <p>a counter is a device which stores (and sometimes displays) 
            the number of times a particular event or process has occurred, 
            often in relationship to a clock. </p>

        <p>Library of parameterized modules (LPM) 
            functions in your VHDL design</p>

        <h3 id="Memory_UNITS">Memory Units</h3>
        <p>RAM is short for “random access memory” and while 
            it might sound mysterious, RAM is one of the most 
            fundamental elements of computing</p>

        <h3 id="Logical">Logical Components</h3>
            <p>All digital systems can be constructed by only three 
                basic logic gates. These basic gates are called 
                the AND gate, the OR gate, and the NOT gate.</p>
